        <h1 id="about">What is TeachQuest?</h1>
        <p>TeachQuest was founded 3 years ago in quarantine teaching the youth about coding and technology at a more affordable price point compared to other camps. We now have expanded to algebra 1, public peaking, business building and more. Our goal is to equip the next generation of kids to change the world with first world skills.</p>
        <p>So join us and make your kids curious about the endless possibilities of knowledge, inspire them to explore new horizons, nurture their thirst for learning, and empower them to become innovative thinkers and problem solvers!</p>
